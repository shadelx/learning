# Learning

This project is a comprehensive collection of resources and examples covering basic and advanced programming concepts across multiple programming languages. It is organized by language and topic, providing hands-on code samples for learning and reference.

## Contents

- **Assembly**  
  Examples for GAS, NASM, and PIC-AS, including basic programs and hardware interfacing.

- **C**  
  Covers arrays, pointers, memory management, data structures (stack, queue), bitwise operations, function pointers, and more.

- **C++**  
  Demonstrates OOP concepts (inheritance, templates, operator overloading), static and dynamic linking, and library usage.

- **Java**  
  Includes Swing GUI, JavaFX, generics, dependency injection/inversion, external JAR usage, and REST API examples.

- **Python**  
  Features OOP, inheritance, iterators, generators, decorators, closures, property usage, and functional programming concepts.

- **JavaScript**  
  Shows object-oriented programming, array methods, callbacks, promises, async/await, and basic REST API server/client.

- **Arduino**  
  Serial communication and command-line interface examples for microcontroller projects.

- **Micro-C**  
  Embedded C examples for microcontroller programming.

- **Data Structures**  
  Implementations of stack, queue, and circular queue in C.

- **Notes**  
  Additional notes and explanations on programming concepts.
